# VueNumLocaleInput

---

> [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) **form input field** component edited as **numeric input field**, displayed as **language sensitive text field**

---

* For language-sensitive representation of numbers see [Number.prototype.toLocaleString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString)
* Locale formatted number is displayed **only** if the field does **not** have focus. Otherwise it looks and behaves as normal numeric input field.
* Especially useful for creating clear and easy to read tables containing numbers.

## Rationale

The basic idea is that it would be difficult to make **editable** numeric form field that is formatted in some way (e.g. spaces between numbers). However, it is very easy to make a non-editable text field displaying a number in localized format (see [Number.prototype.toLocaleString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString) and [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat)).

Thus, the component internally switches between a "localized" non-editable `input type="text"` (the default display) and a "normal" `input  type="number"` in which editing takes place. The component switches to the numeric input if it gets focus. After losing focus, it switches back to the text localised input.

## Usage

The component can be handled like a normal numeric `input` element, because both internal input fields take the attributes passed to the component (you can define css classes, `min`, `max`, etc.).

> Warning! The component **must not** have a `type` defined (`text`, `number`, event, other). The type is defined by the two internal inputs themselves, and an external definition would override this.
